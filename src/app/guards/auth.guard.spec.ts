     *
     * Instead, we document the expected behavior here for reference:
     *
     * When authenticated = true:
     * - Should return true (allow access)
     *
     * When authenticated = false:
     * - Should call keycloak.login({ redirectUri: window.location.origin + state.url })
     * - Should return false (deny access)
     *
     * These behaviors are tested at the E2E level with real Keycloak integration.
